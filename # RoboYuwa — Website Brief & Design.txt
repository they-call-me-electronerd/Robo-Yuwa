**Spacing & radius:**

* 8px baseline grid
* Border-radius: 12px for cards, 9999px for pill CTAs

## 7. Frontend Tech Stack & Architecture

**Core:** HTML5, CSS3
**Frameworks / Tools:**

* Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)
* Bootstrap (optional for quick components if desired)
* Vanilla JavaScript or small framework (Alpine.js / HTMX) for interactivity
* Build tooling: Vite or webpack
* Icons: Heroicons / FontAwesome / Lucide
* Images: SVG for illustrations; WebP fallback

**Folder structure (recommended)**

```
/src
  /components
  /layouts
  /pages
  /styles  (tailwind config, base.css)
  /assets (images, svg)
  /data  (markdown, json for projects)
/dist
```

**Integration tips:**

* Use Tailwind as primary styling engine; use Bootstrap utilities only when rapid prototyping is needed.
* Keep components atomic and reusable.
* Use CSS variables for theme tokens to enable easy color tweaks.

## 8. SEO & Content Strategy

**On-page SEO basics:**

* Unique page title and meta description for every page.
* Use semantic HTML5 (header, main, article, section, footer).
* H1 per page, hierarchical headings (H2, H3).
* Image ALT text and descriptive filenames.
* Sitemap.xml and robots.txt.

**Structured data:**

* Use JSON-LD for Organization, Website, Event, and Article schema.

**Performance & Core Web Vitals:**

* Defer non-critical JS, preconnect to required origins, compress assets.
* Use responsive images (`srcset`) and `loading="lazy"`.

**Content plan:**

* Launch with: About, Programs (3 flagship), 5 project case studies, Events (next 3), Blog with 5 tutorials.
* Ongoing: weekly or biweekly tutorials, monthly event recaps.

## 9. Accessibility & Internationalization

* Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA.
* Keyboard navigable forms and menus.
* ARIA attributes where appropriate.
* Prepare for Nepali language support (UTF-8, RTL not required) and local date formats.

## 10. Analytics, Monitoring & Legal

* GA4, Google Search Console
* Error logging: Sentry or similar
* Privacy policy & cookie notice
* GDPR / data handling notes for newsletter and registration
